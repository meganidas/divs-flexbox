                I was born and raised in rural NC, but my family is from Miami FL. I owe my love and appreciation of the mountains to my transplant parents. Who brought me on hiking trips to the Smokies, and Blue Ridge every year while I was growing up.

                My passion: I LOVE learning new things! You could say my hobby is trying new hobbies. I find that seemingly unrelated disciplines can help you understand more. Having a broad spectrum of experience makes you more resourceful and creative. Some of the skills I'm developing right now are gardening, beekeeping, playing the banjo, and coding websites!

                A fun fact: In a different time in my life I was a fire performer in a circus, a yoga instructor, and a massage therapist. I am a mother of 3 and after the birth of my first kiddo, I decided to make some changes that would allow me to be home with him more. So my journey into hobby farming began.
